# Blinkit-Sales-Project
About this Project
As part of my recent project, I developed a comprehensive sales analytics dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard is designed to provide in-depth insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) critical to the operations of Blinkit. The primary goal was to create a user-friendly and interactive interface that enables stakeholders to monitor and analyze various metrics related to total sales, item performance, outlet characteristics, and customer ratings.

Key Responsibilities and Achievements
Data Integration and Management:
Utilized Power BI for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
Integrated data from various sources into Power BI for seamless visualization and analysis.
Dashboard Development:
Designed and developed a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI that includes:
Total Sales by Fat Content
Total Sales by Item Type
Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales
Total Sales by Outlet Establishment
Sales by Outlet Size
Sales by Outlet Location

All Metrics by Outlet Type
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Implemented KPIs to track and monitor:
Total Sales: The overall revenue generated from all items sold.
