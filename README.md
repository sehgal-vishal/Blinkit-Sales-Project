I developed a comprehensive sales analytics dashboard using Power BI for Blinkit. This dashboard provides in-depth insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) critical to Blinkit's operations.

Key Features:

Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales (Stacked Column Chart)
Total Sales by Outlet Establishment (Line Chart)
Sales by Outlet Size (Donut/Pie Chart)
Sales by Outlet Location (Funnel Map)
All Metrics by Outlet Type (Matrix Card)
Key Performance Indicators:
Total Sales: Overall revenue from all items sold.
Average Sales: Average revenue per sale.
Number of Items: Total count of different items sold.
Average Rating: Average customer rating for items sold.
Outcome
The dashboard enhanced data-driven decision-making by providing clear insights into sales performance and operational efficiency.
